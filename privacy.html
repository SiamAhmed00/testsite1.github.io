                    <p>The Online Academy of Applied English (‘Applied English’, ‘the Company, ‘we’, ‘us’’) is committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects and safely and securely &nbsp;processing their data in accordance with all of our legal obligations. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and this Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.</p>
                    <h6>Who we are</h6>

                    <h6>Why do we have this policy?</h6>
                    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is part of the EU data protection reform package through which the European Commission aims to strengthen the rights of individuals in the digital age and simplify the rules for businesses in the EU. It became directly applicable in all EU and EEA Member States as of 25 May 2018. Although Applied English’s current commercial activities are entirely focused on the Asia Pacific region, we recognise that our customers may include individuals and organisations whose headquarters are in the EU.</p>
                    <p>The GDPR significantly changes the EU data protection regulatory landscape, setting stricter requirements, reaching more companies, and imposing potentially higher penalties. For example, companies must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implement programmatic measures to ensure and actively demonstrate compliance</li>
                        <li>Demonstrate a commitment to accountability</li>
                        <li>Have in place appropriate training and governance</li>
                        <li>Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the rights of individuals when designing a processing system and processing data Conduct data protection impact assessments of high risk processing activities</li>
                        <li>Implement privacy by design and by default</li>
                        <li>Implement data breach notification procedures</li>
                        </ul>
